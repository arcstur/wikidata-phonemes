<h2>Welcome to Wikidata Phonemes!</h2>

<p>
  This is the web application developed specifically for
  <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikidata_IOLab">Wikidata IOLab</a>.
  In here you can add phonemes to a whole bunch of languages, basing your
  work on the work that the brazilian students of their national olympiad
  did while editing Wikipedia.
</p>

<h3> Activity </h3>

<p>
  In <a href="/activity">Activity</a>, you can see the languages
  that the brazilians worked on and choose one to edit on Wikidata.
</p>

<h4> Step by step </h4>

<ol>
  <li> Open the Wikipedia article, read and understand the language's phonology </li>
  <li> Go to the History and copy the latest revision <em>permalink</em></li>
  <li> Go to the language page in this app and use the permalink to reference your phoneme claims </li>
</ol>

<h3> Current status </h3>

<p>
  In <a href="/languages">Languages</a>, you can see
  all the languages in Wikidata which have phonemes connected
  to them. We hope to increase those numbers a lot
  with this activity!
</p>
